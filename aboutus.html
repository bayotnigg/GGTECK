				<h1>The purpose of our website and how it was made</h1>

				<p>
					The creators of this webpage are Julian Cristoff also known as the
					head of this project and our main programmer and stylist, Yliasz Evan
					Jarek Belga also known as our associate programmer, Jeuz Rei M. Hallig
					also known as our researcher and the one who finds our source of
					information. The purpose of our webpage is to provide baseline
					information about General Science and some of its sub-categories for
					example we will give our complete known information and we will also
					give out quizzes to challenge your own understanding of each lessons
					given. This was created during our class on February 19th 2025, it was
					due to a peculiar asignment on doing a group assignment to make a
					webpage that includes the following tags: audio, video and images and
					font styling, and that was the time where we planned this project.
